# 🌳 Day 80 — GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 🔄 Problem: Level Order Traversal | BFS on Binary Tree
### 📘 Problem Statement:
Traverse a binary tree level by level, from left to right, and return the nodes in that order grouped by depth.

## 🧠 Approach & Insights:
✅ Used Breadth-First Search (BFS) via a queue
✅ Captured each level's nodes in a temporary list
✅ Tracked level size dynamically to segment levels
✅ Efficiently handled left and right children using simple conditional enqueuing

## ✅ Performance Snapshot:
✅ Test Cases Passed: 1120 / 1120

🧪 Attempts: 1 / 1

🎯 Accuracy: 100%

⏱️ Execution Time: 0.14s

🎖️ Points Scored: 2 / 2

## 🔁 Key Takeaway:
In tree-based problems, queue-based BFS is a robust tool for traversing breadth-wise, maintaining clean structure and intuitive control. 🌿🔁
